# Terraform

## main.tf File Creation

This file stores the declerations that we make in Terraform.  This document will have the following elements:
   * Terraform
   * Provider
   * Resource
```tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  backend "local" {}  # Can change from "local" to "gcs" (for google) or "s3" (for aws), if you would like to preserve your tf-state online
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.project
  region = var.region
  // credentials = file(var.credentials)  # Use this if you do not want to set env-var GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
}

# Data Lake Bucket
# Ref: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket
resource "google_storage_bucket" "data-lake-bucket" {
  name          = "${local.data_lake_bucket}_${var.project}" # Concatenating DL bucket & Project name for unique naming
  location      = var.region

  # Optional, but recommended settings:
  storage_class = var.storage_class
  uniform_bucket_level_access = true

  versioning {
    enabled     = true
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
    condition {
      age = 30  // days
    }
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

# DWH
# Ref: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_dataset
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
  dataset_id = var.BQ_DATASET
  project    = var.project
  location   = var.region
}
```
The variables.tf file will contain all of the variables that we referenced in the main.tf file

```tf
locals {
  data_lake_bucket = "dtc_data_lake"
}

variable "project" {
  description = "Your GCP Project ID"
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region for GCP resources. Choose as per your location: https://cloud.google.com/about/locations"
  default = "europe-west6"
  type = string
}

variable "storage_class" {
  description = "Storage class type for your bucket. Check official docs for more info."
  default = "STANDARD"
}

variable "BQ_DATASET" {
  description = "BigQuery Dataset that raw data (from GCS) will be written to"
  type = string
  default = "trips_data_all"
}
```
